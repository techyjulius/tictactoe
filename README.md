# Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe game built using react.

### Steps to Run / Test

- Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:techyjulius/tictactoe.git`
- Run `npm install` to install all the packages required
- Run `npm test` to run all the tests in the test suits which are part of this project
- Run `npm start` to launch this app on your local environment

Note: No state manangement package or 'react contexts and hooks' were used in this project because this was a small project which to my judgement state could be managed without use of any of those.
However, I will be adding redux later to demonstrate how redux can be used in this project.
